Asian American and Latino Community-Based and Advocacy Organizations (1868–2016)

There is no comprehensive, ready-made dataset on Asian American and Latino advocacy organizations and community-based organizations (CBOs). Existing Asian American and Latino organizational directories typically cover only specific regions or national-level organizations. I therefore constructed an original dataset from scratch. Below, I describe the data generation process, the steps taken to ensure data quality, and the limitations of the dataset.
I compiled the dataset between May 2017 and August 2017. Data collection proceeded from scratch and drew on four primary organizational directories: (1) Encyclopedia of Associations: National Organizations of the United States, (2) Encyclopedia of Associations: Regional, State, and Local Organizations of the United States, (3) National Directory of Nonprofit Organizations, and (4) data from the National Center for Charitable Statistics (NCCS). Collecting data from multiple sources is useful to reduce sampling bias. Prior research has relied on the Encyclopedia of Associations to trace the formation of racial and ethnic organizations (Minkoff 1995; Okamoto 2014), while NCCS data are particularly useful for identifying more recently founded nonprofits. In addition, using multiple data sources helps reducing sam
The resulting dataset includes 299 Asian American organizations and 519 Latino organizations. The number of Asian American organizations identified is approximately 266 percent greater than the count reported in Okamoto’s study of panethnic Asian American organizations (2014), even though her dataset included all types of organizations rather than being limited to advocacy or CBOs. Okamoto generously shared her data with me, and I counted only the panethnic organizations in her dataset.
I identified panethnic organizations using a multi-step search strategy across all data sources that accounted for different organizational naming logics. I began with organizations that used explicit panethnic identifiers in their names. For Asian American organizations, these initial search terms included “Asian,” “Asian American,” and “Asian Pacific American.” For Latino organizations, they included “Hispanic,” “Latino,” “Latina,” “La Raza,” and “Centro.”
Because directory searches rely on organizational titles and brief descriptions, CBOs that did not use panethnic identifiers in their names would not appear in the initial search results. I therefore expanded the search to include CBOs that used ethnic identifiers rather than panethnic ones. These additional terms included “Chinese,” “Chinatown,” “Japanese,” and “Filipino” for the Asian American case, and “Mexican,” “Chicano,” “Chicana,” “Puerto Rican,” “Cuban,” and “Spanish” for the Latino case.
This strategy reflects the historical context of the 1960s and 1970s, when it was often unclear whether organizing under Asian American or Latino panethnic labels would succeed. CBOs deeply rooted in particular ethnic communities faced incentives to retain ethnic identifiers even as they pursued broader coalitions.
Finally, I identified a smaller set of CBOs that used neither panethnic nor ethnic identifiers in their names. To locate these CBOs, I relied on primary and secondary sources documenting Asian American and Latino CBOs. For example, the ASPIRA Association, a Latino CBO focused on educational access, does not include either ethnic or panethnic markers in its title. These uniquely named CBOs constitute a small share of the dataset, accounting for 7 percent of Asian American CBOs and 3 percent of Latino CBOs.
Overall, CBOs using explicit panethnic identifiers make up the majority of the dataset: 85 percent of Asian American CBOs and 89 percent of Latino CBOs.
To establish construct validity, I reviewed each organization to confirm that it was panethnic not only in name but also in its stated mission and programs. This validation relied primarily on organizational websites. For organizations without websites, I supplemented this review with information from news archives and public records. With the exception of a small number of well-known national organizations, such as the National Council of La Raza (now Unidos), internal documents were generally unavailable. Although website-based validation has limitations, as organizations with stronger web presences are more likely to be observed, it remains one of the most feasible ways to assess organizational identity.
I used the same process to classify organizations as advocacy organizations, CBOs, or hybrid entities, and to determine their founding years. When possible, I relied on historical accounts rather than Internal Revenue Service incorporation dates, as some organizations incorporated several years after they began operating. Using this approach, I obtained founding years for approximately 77 percent of Asian American organizations and 71 percent of Latino organizations. When these data were unavailable, I emailed the staff at these organizations directly. To increase reliability, I excluded organizations for which I could find no information beyond IRS records as of August 2017, as their continued operation and substantive activities could not be verified. I also omitted foundations and chambers of commerce because their distinct primary revenue sources and institutional roles make them substantively different from advocacy organizations and CBOs. For similar reasons, I excluded mutual aid organizations, labor unions, and religious organizations, whose core functions and organizational logics differ from those of advocacy and service-oriented CBOs.
The primary limitation of the dataset is recency bias. Nonprofit directories do not capture defunct organizations, and as a result, the dataset includes only organizations that both survived and appeared in the data sources as of 2017. For example, the Bay Area Human Service Directory, compiled by local Asian American social workers and published in 1977, identified eight Asian human service organizations in San Francisco. One of these, the International Institute of San Francisco, serves non-English-speaking immigrants rather than Asian populations specifically. Excluding this organization, my dataset misses two of the remaining seven organizations: the Asian Community Center and the San Francisco Bay Area Asian American Community Mental Health Training Center. Although this implies a missing rate of approximately 30 percent, this case may be an exception rather than the norm, given San Francisco’s historical role in Asian American activism.
